# PYTORCH TUTORIAL

This repository documents my learning progres with PyTorch , following the official **PyTorch BLitz (60-minute) ** ** Tutorial and Learn the basics**

The project focuses onundertsanding the core concepts of PyTorch, including tensors, automatic differentiation, neural networks, and training a classifier.
## Project Description
This project documents the fundamnetal workflow of building  and training neural networks using PyTorch.

Concecepts covered:
- Tensor creation, manipulation, and operations
- Automatic differentiation using Autograd
- Neural network definition and architrcture
- Loss functions and optimisation
- Training a classifier using real datasets
- Model training workflow e.g. forward pass, bakpropogation, weight updates)

The goal of this repository is to build a solid foundation in PyTorch for future machine learning and AI projects.
